# Nand2Tetris

My solutions for the projects in [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris parts I &amp; II](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) courses.

1. [Logic Gates](https://github.com/mroobit/nand2tetris/tree/main/01) - written in an HDL, starting with their provided nandgate
2. [Basic Chips](https://github.com/mroobit/nand2tetris/tree/main/02) - written in HDL, using logic gates written in previous chapter
3. [Memory Chips and Program Counter](https://github.com/mroobit/nand2tetris/tree/main/03) - written in HDL, using basic chips and logic gates from previous chapters
4. [Assembly Language programs](https://github.com/mroobit/nand2tetris/tree/main/04) - written in Hack assembly language: multiplication and screen-fill
5. [CPU, Main Memory, and Computer](https://github.com/mroobit/nand2tetris/tree/main/05) - written in HDL, using chips written in chapters 1-3
6. [Assembler](https://github.com/mroobit/nand2tetris/tree/main/06) - written in Go, translates Hack assembly language to Hack binary code (both with and without symbolic references)
7. [Partial VM Translator](https://github.com/mroobit/nand2tetris/tree/main/07) - written in Go, translates VM commands to Hack assembly language code (arithmetic-logical and push/pop commands only)
8. [Full VM Translator](https://github.com/mroobit/nand2tetris/tree/main/08) - written in Go, translates VM commands to Hack assembly language code (handles multiple .vm files, branching commands, and function commands)
